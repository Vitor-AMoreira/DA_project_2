In this programming project, we were asked to design efficient algorithms to find optimal routes for vehicles in generic shipping and delivery scenarios, from urban deliveries to ocean shipping. This problem corresponds to the T\+SP. As the T\+SP is intractable, there are no known efficient algorithms to solve it. Backtracking techniques can find the optimal solution to this problem. If the size of the graph is relatively low, the application of these approaches might be reasonable. However, as we concluded in this project, their application to large graphs is infeasible, due to their high computational complexity. Therefore, approximation algorithms based on heuristics were devised to efficiently address T\+S\+P-\/based problems. This class of approaches provide in many cases near-\/optimal solutions and may also prove bounds on the ratio between the approximate and the optimal solutions.

In this project we were asked to design efficient heuristics for the T\+SP applied to diverse scenarios. We were given multiple graphs and a selected departure and arrival point (or node). While we were given plenty of freedom to explore effective heuristics, we were strongly suggested to at least implement the heuristic that takes advantage of a triangular approximation as this one has a guaranteed approximation bound for an important class of graphs. In particular, we designed appropriate heuristics according to the input data, such as the size and type of the graph, as well as additional information contained in the dataset. In this regard, we analysed which heuristics were more adequate to a given graph and analyse the trade-\/offs between optimality and efficiency.

Additionally, we implemented a backtracking algorithm to the T\+SP. Although this algorithm is not efficient, it enabled us to determine the optimal solution to this problem for small graphs. These results helped us analyse the optimality of our heuristics on small graphs.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Authors}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
